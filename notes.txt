have errors that lead to rejection of sample return nothing instead of throwing an error. This allows the sampler to continue and potentially find a valid sample in subsequent iterations.



model = TransformedLogDensity(
    data = randn(100),
    lpdf = normal_lpdf,
    transforms = [IdentityTransformation(), LogTransformation()],
    buffer = zeros(2)
)

∇logp!(model, [0.0, 0.0])
